      The Usage Data Collector collects information
about how individuals are using the Eclipse platform. This
information is periodically uploaded to servers hosted by
The Eclipse Foundation (though this is configurable). The intent
is to use this data to help committers and organizations better
understand how developers are using Eclipse.
Target Users of the Data:
* Users of Eclipse
* Committers working on Eclipse projects
* ISVs and organization creating Eclipse based software
* Enterprise IT departments that make extensive use of Eclipse
Foundation
* Academic researchers that want to study how developer work
Data to Be Collected
Captured data is associated with a user through a combination
of workstation and workspace ids that are automatically generated
by the collector. This identification is not tied to any personal
information about the user.
The usage data monitors:
* Start up and shutdown times of a workspace
* What is being used and when (timestamp), including
1. Loaded bundles
2. Commands accessed via keyboard shortcuts
3. Actions invoked via menus or toolbars
4. Perspective changes
5. View usage
6. Editor usage 
Where possible, the usage data collector also capture the symbolic
name and version of the bundle contributing the command/action/perspective/view/editor.
